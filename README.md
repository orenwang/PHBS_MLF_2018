# Instrument Classification Project
> Automatic instrument classification from music

We intend to perform automatic identification of instrument classes from monophonic and polyphonic music audio via machine learning method. We only focus on three different classes of instrument, which are piano, guitar and strings.



## Database

We build our own audio database based on a selection from 130,000 midi files from public website as follows: 
1. We select midi files that have been already labeled by one of the three instruments above.
2. We then extract and saperate them either into single-track midi files (monophonic) or into multi-track midi files (polyphonic). 
3. We use instrument sounds sampler, such as Kontakt 5, to render midi files into music.
4. We label our data during the music generation process.

Midi:

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
